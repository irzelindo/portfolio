from a provided PDF design [mockup](https://storage.googleapis.com/supplemental_media/udacityu/2655898586/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf)
The developer should follow the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/45/view) in order to get his project approved.
Once project done it should be evaluated and approved as valid, be sure to validate your
code in one of many code validators available online e.g. [W3C's Validators](http://validator.w3.org/)
